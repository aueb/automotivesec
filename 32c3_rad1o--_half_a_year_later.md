# 32c3\_rad1o--\_half\_a\_year\_later

News about the rad1o half a year later – cool stuff that happened, and why you need an SDR.

The rad1o was the badge for the Camp 2015. This talk will be a bit about what went into a project of this size, what went well and what not so much. The main part is about what we \(and lots of other volunteers\) have done with it – both standalone and with a computer, and why y’all need to play more with SDR.
