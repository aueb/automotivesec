# CANUSB

.. General Information: CANUSB is a very small dongle that plugs into any PC USB Port and gives an instant CAN connectivity. This means it can be treated by software as a standard COM Port \(virtual serial RS232 port\) with the FTDI USB drivers which eliminates the need for any extra drivers \(DLL\) or by installing a direct driver DLL \(D2XX\) together with our CANUSB DLL for faster communications and higher CAN bus loads. Sending and receiving can be done in standard ASCII format.
