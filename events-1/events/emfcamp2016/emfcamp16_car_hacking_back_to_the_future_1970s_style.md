## Part 1 @ [EMFCamp 2016](EMFCamp2016)

* Dan Smith 

A brief overview of one hackers journey taking the best of modern automotive technology and retrofitting it all into a car from the same era as the Intel 4004. Taking a 1974 Ford Escort Mk1 with minimal functionality and bolting on electronic fuel injection, turbochargers, digital instrument clusters, CAN-bus networks, Raspberry Pis and ultimately the ‘cloud’. Touching on multiple engineering disciplines; automotive engineering, EE, CS, cyber security, and product design. All In the effort of chasing efficiency, fuelled by tenacious curiosity.

## Part 2 @ [EMFCamp 2018](EMFCamp2018)

* Dan Smith & Laura Hyatt

Sequel for the EMF’16 talk on hacking modern automotive tech into a 1974 Ford Escort Mk1. An updated journey on; connecting the car to the cloud using AWS for GPS tracking and remote engine start, 3D printing prototype engine parts and reverse engineering CAN signals to test a home-brew digital cluster built using a Raspberry Pi running a custom Linux image.
