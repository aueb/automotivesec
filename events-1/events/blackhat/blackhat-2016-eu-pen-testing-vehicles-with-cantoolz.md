* CANToolz is an open-source framework for working with CAN bus. In this presentation we will demonstrate use-cases and examples of black-box analyses of CAN network and ECU devices. This framework based on modules and libraries that can be used all together in different combos to get exactly what researcher/tester needs.

    \
    1\. What tester could do over OBD2 port?\


    * UDS scanning, sub-function scanning
    * Tester tool testing and traffic analysis

    \
    2\. CAN Switch/Hub scanning\


    * What messages could be routed from one bus to another?

    \
    3\. Understanding the traffic\


    * How to find "what means what"
    * Finding control frames
    * Finding status frames\


    \
    4\. Running MitM\


    * DIY: anti-thief system\


    \
    Also, you could use CANToolz for integration/security tests as part of developing process (SDLC), and we will cover this part as well.
