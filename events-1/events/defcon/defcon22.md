A Survey of Remote Automotive Attack Surfaces Charlie Miller Security Engineer, Twitter Chris Valasek Director of Threat Intelligence, IOActive

Automotive security concerns have gone from the fringe to the mainstream with security researchers showing the susceptibility of the modern vehicle to local and remote attacks. A malicious attacker leveraging a remote vulnerability could do anything from enabling a microphone for eavesdropping to turning the steering wheel to disabling the brakes.

Last year, we discussed 2 particular vehicles. However, since each manufacturer designs their fleets differently; analysis of remote threats must avoid generalities. This talk takes a step back and examines the automotive network of a large number of different manufacturers from a security perspective. From this larger dataset we can begin to answer questions like: Are some cars more secure from remote compromise than others? Has automotive network security changed for the better \(or worse\) in the last 5 years? What does the future of automotive security hold and how can we protect our vehicles from attack moving forward?

Charlie Miller is a security engineer at Twitter. Back when he still had time to research, he was the first with a public remote exploit for both the iPhone and the G1 Android phone. He is a four time winner of the CanSecWest Pwn2Own competition. He has authored three information security books and holds a PhD from the University of Notre Dame. He has hacked browsers, phones, cars, and batteries. Charlie spends his free time trying to get back together with Apple, but sadly they still list their relationship status as "It's complicated".
