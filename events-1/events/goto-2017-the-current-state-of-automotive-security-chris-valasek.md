The connected car has become as ubiquitous as our smart phones and personal computers, but many people don’t realize that the manufacturer isn’t the only party involved in connecting and controlling your vehicle.

This talk will go over some flaws found in Jeep Cherokee in the Summer of 2015 and explain that those events show connected vehicles are not only technologically advanced but consist of many players and processes. Each player in the connected car game should not only be concerned about connectivity but also security. This talk will show the audience that we can all learn from past mistakes to make a more secure future.
